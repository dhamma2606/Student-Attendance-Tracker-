# Student Attendance Tracker

The **Student Attendance Tracker** is a Python project that automatically records and analyzes students’ attendance for 30 days using **NumPy** and **Pandas**. It reads student names from a CSV file, simulates daily attendance based on different probabilities, and calculates each student’s total presents, absents, attendance percentage, and qualification status. The project helps both students and administrators easily track attendance performance.
The system assigns an 80% presence probability to half the students and 40% to the rest, then generates a complete monthly attendance sheet. It also prepares a daily summary showing presentees, absentees, and their counts. Students with 75% or higher attendance are marked **Qualified**, while others are **Disqualified**. The data is neatly organized into two CSV files — one for individual attendance (`students_attendance.csv`) and another for daily summaries (`daily_attendance_summary.csv`).
This project is built using pure Python, NumPy, and Pandas without any Jupyter-specific code. It’s easy to run, lightweight, and highly useful for teachers, students, and administrators to monitor attendance efficiently. Simply place your `students.csv` file, run the Python script, and get complete attendance reports ready for analysis.
